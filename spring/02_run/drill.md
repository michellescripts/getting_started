# Run

Running a Spring application

## Learning Objectives

## Instructions

- If you're starting here, use the `02_run/demo` directory
- If you completed drill 1, `Setup`, you may use the `demo` directory created in your workspace, or the demo directory provided

------------------------

Before beginning, your demo directory should look like this:
    `demo/src/main/java/com.setup.demo/Application.java`
    
If it looks like this: `demo/src/main/java/com/setup/demo/Application.java`, IntelliJ does not recognize this as a maven project

To set this up, do the following:
- In the project directory panel, note the location of the pom.xml file
- In the left panel menu, click maven projects
- Drag and drop the pom.xml file into the space
- Your project should now register and the directory structure will automatically update to `com.setup.demo`
     

### A simple application
 
In order to run our application, we need to first provide one.



#### Controller

1. Create a web controller
    `demo/src/main/java/com.setup.demo/DemoController.java`
