# Kata

Java Practice

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply a ternary operator to a logic problem
1. Practice implementing Java methods
1. Stretch: Describe a built-in Java method 

## Instructions

#### Getting Started

- **Import the Maven Project**

    Before beginning, your demo directory should look like this:
    `01_kata/src/main/java/com.gettingstarted.kata/App`
    
    If it looks like this: `01_kata/src/main/java/com/gettingstarted/kata/App`, do the following:
    - In the project directory panel (left), note the location of the pom.xml file
        (`01_kata/pom.xml`)
    - In the right panel menu, click maven projects
    - Drag and drop the pom.xml file into the space
    - Your project should now register and the directory structure will automatically update to `com.gettingstarted.kata`

#### Tests

Run the tests
- There are many ways to run the test suite
    - click the play icon in the gutter, select `Run AppTest`
    - right click the AppTest class, select `Run AppTest`
    - place your cursor in the AppTest class, ctrl+shift+r  
- In the project directory panel
    - right click AppTest, select `Run AppTest`
- You can run all the tests, or run one at a time, singling out the test for the method you're implementing
    
    
#### Implement

Start adding the logic to make each test pass
- Tests should pass without making any changes to the test file
- There are many different approaches to solving these problems with no 'right' or 'wrong' way
- However, by following the provided hints, you will be able to accomplish the learning objectives for this drill
